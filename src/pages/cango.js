                    <h3>Discover Events. Meet People. Build Community.</h3>
                    <p>My peers and I found ourselves constantly missing out on events‚Äîeither because we never saw the emails or because they got buried in endless newsletters. We wanted to build something that made it easier for students like us to actually enjoy what our campus has to offer, without relying on manually checking dozens of calendars.</p>
                    <p>So, four of us got together to build <strong>CanGo</strong>, a platform to make campus events more social, discoverable, and personalized for Brown and RISD students. Instead of getting overwhelmed by Events@Brown or missing word-of-mouth gatherings, students can now find what they care about‚Äîand who they'll enjoy it with.</p>

                    <p>While our prototype demonstrates the core features of CanGo, there are problems we would address before considering a full launch:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Moderation Tools:</strong> Right now, anyone can post any kind of event without oversight. We'd need a system for flagging, reviewing, or restricting inappropriate or spammy events to ensure safety and relevance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Event Population:</strong> Our current setup relies heavily on user-submitted events. To prevent an empty feed, we plan to automatically populate events using web scraping from public calendars, student organization sites, and other sources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability & Performance:</strong> As usage grows, features like friend recommendations, smart RSVPs, and personalized feeds would need optimization for speed and scalability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Better Feedback Loops:</strong> We'd also want more ways for users to provide tailored feedback with post-event questionnaires, helping us improve recommendations and trust signals.</li>
                    </ul>
