Hi, I'm **Aarav Kumar!** I'm a junior at Brown University, where I’m pursuing a BSc in Applied Math – Computer Science. I'm passionate about building creative tools that help people connect, express themselves, and access technology in more inclusive and mindful ways. My interests sit at the intersection of **design, accessibility, and software development**, with a special love for creative technologies and data visualization.

Outside of coding and math, here are a few things I love:
- 🥐 **Croissant hunting.** I love exploring cafes in search of the perfect croissant... flaky, buttery, and slightly warm. My favorites are banana cinnamon or pistachio croissants.

- 🎨 **Making art!** From designing websites to crocheting beluga whales, painting miniature watercolors to blowing glass ornaments, I’m always experimenting with new ways to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/artbyaaravv/" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link" style="color: var(--primary-color);"><u>be creative</u>.</a>

- 🌍 **Brown GRC**. As a lead researcher and analyst at Brown GRC, I help global non-profits in scaling their impact. From Foodbank Singapore to <a href="https://grcglobalgroup.substack.com/p/project-spotlight-dear-em-counselor" target="_blank" aria-label="External Link" style="color: var(--primary-color);"><u>Dear Em New Zealand</u></a> (a sexual violence prevention initiative), I’m passionate about supporting mission-driven organizations in making a difference.
